# 2021-2022-Premier-League-Stats

This project is based on another sport I find fascinating (soccer/football) and is used as a deep dive behind the stats that accompany this past English Premier League season (2021-2022). The style of soccer being played changes every year and this project was used to gain insights into how each team developed throughout the season and the disparity between the top 4 teams and the relegation bound teams. I have used stats from all the games of the 2021-2022 season to determine if teams have improved in certain categories such as scoring, assists, clean sheets, and more.

The objective that I have set for this project is to derive insights that would help evaluate the improvements or deficiencies that have occurred between this past EPL season. These findings can be used to determine where teams should improve upon in the 2022-2023 season to either push for European Cup games, become a better team than the previous year, or avoid relegation to the second tier of English Soccer.

I am tasked with:

- Performing some exploratory data analysis.
- What kind of exploratory analyses on the relevant fields can give more insights about the team's current standing?
- What the key statistics that are sepearting winning teams from losing teams?
- Extraction of sample data sets using SQL.
- Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations.
- Cleaning the dataset in Excel.
